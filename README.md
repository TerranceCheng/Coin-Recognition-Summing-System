# Coin-Recognition-Summing-System-2022-09-20-
This is the final year project for my Diploma in Information Technology.

This system was created on 20/09/2022 using Python language.

The coin summing system was built solely to calculate the coins from Malaysia. Although it can also recognize coins from other countries, the accuracy will be decreased due to the difference in coin's sizes.
